Application of Machine Learning Classifiers for Predicting the Outcome of Bank Telemarketing


The key aims of this research project are to: 
1. Investigate the performance of diverse machine learning classifiers to realistically and effectively predict if a bank client will subscribe to a new bank product without the use of information regarding the contact execution i.e. ‘duration’. Therefore, the objectives will involve:  a) Identifying optimal feature sets for representing bank marketing data.  b) Comparing the performance of parametric & non-parametric algorithms using an appropriate evaluation metric. 
 
2. Consider the effect of ensemble methods on improving algorithm performance due to the scarcity of research that utilise ensemble methods for the bank marketing data set. Therefore, the objectives will involve: a) Combining the classifiers evaluated in the first part to create a new classifier with superior performance using Voting and Adaptive Boosting techniques.
